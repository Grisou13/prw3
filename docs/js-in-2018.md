# Developping in javascript in 2018

Aha, so here you are reading this document trying to learn something about developping in Javascript in 2018... Well, you will learn tools and what they're for, but you'll need to practise to actually learn something!

So here we go.

First of here's a small diagram of what was in the box for 2017

And we're almost going to take the same approach. 
We will see what Node.js is, and how it changed javascript developement. 
Second, we will look at developement tolls, what they are for, and how to use them. 
And last but not least, learning to intergrate almost all of that with a framework.

But first of, let's get the basics of javascript in the box

# Some basics

We won't view what the language looks like, but here are some principals that are widely used in the world of javascript.
Here's what we're gonna cover:
- ES6 / EcmaScript
- Callbacks
- Async functions
- Immuability

## ES6 / EcmaScript

You might have heard this term somewhere on the interwebs. Well it's not for nothing. Javascripts real name is EcmaScript. As of right now we are at version 6, so ES6.

EcmaScript is a standard for javascript that is constantly evolving. Thus far some browsers can interpret ES6, but most of the old browsers can't.
Here's a !(full table)[https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/] on what platform suport what feature!

Since the standard is always evolving, and most browsers can't catch up, developpers have made tools to convert this new fresh shiny ES6 into old code. The most popular tool is called `browserify`.

Browserify staticly reads your code, and converts your written code to old code. Browserify has multiple plugins, that allow you to enable experimental features, or other. We won't go into much deatail about browserify modules, but just know they exist and are widely used.

## Callbacks

Callbacks are the basics of Javascript, it's what javascript is good at. Callbacks are functions run when a particular action is done. These callbacks generally allow for a programmer to call some user land code, when something happened or has ahppened. 
Generally they go like so:
```javascript
// cb is the callback passed to the function
function myFunc(cb){
  alert('let\'s code together');
  cb("wee");
}


myFunc(function(args){
  console.log(args) // will print "wee"
});
```

Here the callback is passed as an argument to `myFunc`, and is declaed inline.

# Node.js

Node.js is a javsacript runtime built upon google v8 javascrtipt engine. Not that you need to know what V8 is, neither what is a runtime. But ultimitly Node.js allows you to execute Javascript code on your machine.
That's a big, a HUGE game changer.
This means that you can write javascript. just like you would write php code.
You will need to install node.js on your machine. As of writing this tutorial, the official nightly build of node.js is `node.js v9.11.1`

Node.js is build upon a plugin system called `modules`. Node.js provides alot of modules, and you can import your own and create your own if you want to.
The cool thing is that you can import and use modules that are built for node.js that you can use on the web, and vice-versa. Although not all node.js modules are browser compatible! (you can't use Jquery in a Node.js context, but there is a Jquery module).

And that's where we're gonna leave node.js. Just know that we will use node.js to use the developpement tools later on.

## Node.js http

A little appart with node.js will be it's ability to be a full api to the system, which means opening and closing tcp ports. That makes node.js prone to creating, and managing http servers.

Here's a simple example from the docs:

```javascript
var http = require('http');

//create a server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.write('Hello World!'); //write a response to the client
  res.end(); //end the response
}).listen(8080); //the server object listens on port 8080
```

# Developpement tools

So we have alot of tools available to develop in 2018, most of them written in javascript.

We'll first see the simple ones, command executors or cli helpers. Then we will see a bit on bundlers, and why you would use one. And to finish we will touch the tacky subjects of modules (they aren't developpement tools, but can be a bit special).
