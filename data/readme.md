# Data extraction

Extracing data from the federal tax was done using tabula [](htt://tabula.technology)

federal_tax_married.csv is a bit weird, since tabula can't reconscialiate lignes that are apprt from a selection. This means, that you will need to select the data you want, and reconsolidate it by hand.
